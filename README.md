# Caesar Cipher

This is a Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption method. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts characters in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. You will be prompted to choose between encoding or decoding a message.
3. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
4. Enter the shift value (an integer between 0 and 25) to determine the level of encryption or decryption.
5. The program will display the result, either the encrypted or decrypted message.
6. You can choose to run the program again or exit.

## Example

Here's how to use the program:

1. Choose "encode" or "decode".
2. Enter the message you want to process (e.g., "hello").
3. Enter the shift value (e.g., 3).
4. The program will display the result (e.g., "khoor").

## Note

- If the shift value is greater than 26, it will be adjusted to ensure it falls within the range [0, 25] (e.g., a shift of 30 is equivalent to a shift of 4).

Feel free to experiment with different messages and shift values to see how the Caesar Cipher works.

Thank you for using the Caesar Cipher program!
